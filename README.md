# Machine-Learning-Age-Classifier

INSERT SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT HERE:

## Estimate your own age locally

Only tested on MacOS Catalina with Python 3.8.   
Required dependencies: TensorFlow, Keras, CV2, face_recognition, Numpy, and PIL.

1. Download the file CNN_inference.py from this repo
2. Download our TensorFlow age estimation models:
  - Either our ADAM model, from Link1. 
  - Our our SGD model, from Link2. 
3. Unzip the zip file, and place the folder in a convenient destination. 
4. Copy the absolute destination path for the folder, and replace the path at line 16 under the variable "model_path" with your own path, in string format. 
5. Run the model, and estimate your own age :D
